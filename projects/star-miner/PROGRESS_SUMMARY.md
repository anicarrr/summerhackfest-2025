- [x] **Contract development environment** prepared
- [x] **Deployment scripts structure** planned

## 🔄 Currently In Progress

### Game Features
- **Idle clicker mechanics** - Basic functionality implemented, needs testing
- **Upgrade system** - UI complete, blockchain integration pending
- **Space-themed animations** - Basic animations working, can be enhanced
- **Game state persistence** - Implemented with Zustand, needs blockchain sync

## 📋 Next Steps (Remaining Tasks)

### 1. Smart Contract Implementation (High Priority)
```solidity
// Need to implement:
- StarMinerCredits.sol (ERC20 with CFX exchange)
- GameStateManager.sol (On-chain game state)
- P2ERewards.sol (Play-to-earn mechanics)
- UpgradeNFTs.sol (NFT-based upgrades)
```

### 2. Wallet Integration (High Priority)
```typescript
// Need to create:
- useWallet hook for MetaMask/Fluent connection
- WalletConnect component
- Network switching functionality
- Transaction handling
```

### 3. Blockchain Integration (High Priority)
```typescript
// Need to implement:
- Contract interaction hooks
- Credits purchase with CFX
- P2E reward claiming
- On-chain game state sync
```

### 4. Testing & Deployment
- Unit tests for game mechanics
- Smart contract tests
- Integration tests
- Testnet deployment
- Frontend deployment

## 🎮 Current Game Status

### Working Features
✅ **Click to earn Stardust** - Functional with visual effects
✅ **Real-time statistics** - Updates automatically
✅ **Upgrade shop interface** - Complete UI with tabs
✅ **Game state persistence** - Saves to localStorage
✅ **Idle generation** - Passive Stardust accumulation
✅ **Prestige system** - Logic implemented
✅ **Space-themed UI** - Beautiful cosmic design

### Pending Features
⏳ **Wallet connection** - UI ready, needs Web3 integration
⏳ **Credits purchase** - UI ready, needs smart contracts
⏳ **P2E rewards** - Logic ready, needs blockchain integration
⏳ **NFT upgrades** - Planned, needs implementation
⏳ **Achievement system** - Designed, needs implementation

## 🚀 Development Server Status

The game is currently running at `http://localhost:3000` with:
- ✅ Hot reload working
- ✅ TailwindCSS compilation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation

## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions

1. **Implement StarMinerCredits smart contract**
2. **Create wallet connection system**
3. **Integrate Web3 functionality**
4. **Deploy contracts to testnet**
5. **Test complete game flow**

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions Made

- **State Management**: Zustand with localStorage persistence
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom space theme
- **Blockchain**: Conflux eSpace for Ethereum compatibility
- **Architecture**: Component-based with clear separation of concerns
- **Development**: TypeScript for type safety

## 🔧 Development Environment

- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version
- **Next.js**: 15.5.2 with Turbopack
- **TypeScript**: ES2020 target for BigInt support
- **TailwindCSS**: Custom space theme configuration
- **Hardhat**: Smart contract development framework

The foundation is solid and the game is ready for blockchain integration to complete the play-to-earn functionality!
