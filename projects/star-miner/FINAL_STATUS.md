   - Test upgrade purchases
   - Test P2E reward claims

### **Phase 2: Testing & Optimization**
3. **Create comprehensive testing suite**
   - Smart contract tests with Hardhat
   - Frontend component tests
   - Integration tests for Web3 functionality

4. **Final testing and optimization**
   - Performance optimization
   - Security audit
   - User experience testing
   - Bug fixes and polish

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Contract Deployment (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Install contract dependencies
cd contracts
npm install

# Configure wallet (add private key to .env)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and API keys

# Deploy to testnet
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### **Step 2: Frontend Integration (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Update contract addresses in frontend
# Copy addresses from deployment output to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDITS_CONTRACT=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_GAMESTATE_CONTRACT=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_P2E_CONTRACT=0x...
```

### **Step 3: Test Complete Flow (10 minutes)**
1. Connect wallet to Conflux eSpace testnet
2. Register as player
3. Purchase Credits with CFX
4. Buy upgrades with Credits
5. Accumulate Stardust
6. Exchange Stardust for CFX rewards
